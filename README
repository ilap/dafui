Design Application Framework's Animation Module

Animation module of the DaF and it implements a simple Animation service for 
Gtk+3 based Widgets until Gtk+4 and Clutter 2.0 arrive. It's similar to Clutter 
API but in 2D, and includes the following:
   * property animation, 
   * timeline, 
   * keyframes. 
Also, it includes some components which extends functionality of Widgets (such 
add opacity/offset) and a very-light-weight animated widget called DeckLayout 
(similar to the notebook widget just much simpler).

Big credits for  Chirstian Hergert as lot of idea came from his Gtk based 
animations.[1][2].
